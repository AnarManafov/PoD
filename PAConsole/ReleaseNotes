********************* Release 1.0.5 2008-08-30 ************************
- The project has been moved to Eclipse 3.4 "Ganymede".
- Fixed many typos.
- Show message box if PAConsole user submits jobs but server is not running [Trac Ticket #70].
- Added a possibility to retrieve jobs logging information from the gLite LB.
  Now using a context menu of the Grid jobs list one can get a full log of the selected job. [Track Ticket #65]
- It is now possible to submit (with different jdl files) and monitor several jobs simultaneously.
  Parametric jobs (gLitePROOF default jdl) monitored as well.
  Every time user clicks the submit button a new job will be submitted and added to the monitoring.
  In this case users can add more workers to a gLitePROOF cluster on the fly and keep tracking all of them.
  Users also can remove job from monitoring using context menu of the jobs list control.
  Remove is not supported for children jobs, only single jobs or parents can be removed from the monitoring. [Track Ticket #71]
- Optimizations in jobs' monitoring, which led to reductions of calls to gLite LB.
- Added a Preferences page. Users now are able to adjust PAConsole settings. Currently the following settings are available:
  * Job Status update interval
  * Workers update interval
  more will come... [Track Ticket #73].
- PAConsole wasn't using the defined jdl file, if a user changed jdl file name manually (without Browse button).
- GUI fixes.
- Minor bugs fixing.

********************* Release 1.0.4 2008-06-13 ************************

- Added a context menu item (Grid page), using which one can retrieve job
  output files of the selected job [Trac Ticket #48].
- Now PAConsole supports serialization [Trac Ticket #47].
  It remembers users settings and, for example, the last submitted job saved too.
  Which allows user to restart PAConsole and still monitor the last job.
  Configuration data saved to and loaded from  $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION/etc/proofagent.cfg.xml.
- ReleaseNotes should be a part of distr [Trac Ticket #61].
