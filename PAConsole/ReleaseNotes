********************* Release 1.0.4 (not yet released)  ************************

- Added a context menu item (Grid page), using which one can retrieve job
  output files of the selected job [Trac Ticket #48].

  It remembers users settings and, for example, the last submitted job saved too.
  Which allows user to restart PAConsole and still monitor the last job.
