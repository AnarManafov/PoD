   	<title>Simple test</title>    
   		<para>
    		The simplest way to test your dynamic PROOF cluster is just to run some simple analysis on it or
        use <ulink url="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/tutorials#runproof">PROOF's tutorial</ulink>.
        If you use PROOF's tutorial, you have to start from the second step - from the runProof.C macro, since PoD will 
        setup a PROOF cluster for you and you therefore don't need to execute the getProof.C macro.
        </para>
    		<para>
   			Now if you want to perform this test. Use the <xref linkend="How_to_run"/> to setup a PROOF cluster.
        As soon as you get required number of workers you can execute the following commands:
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><command>cd $ROOTSYS/tutorials/proof</command>
<prompt>$ </prompt><command>root</command>
<prompt>root[] </prompt><command>runProof.C+</command>
<prompt>root[] </prompt><command>runProof("simple", "master.domain")</command>
</screen>
        <para>
        The second argument to runProof function is an URL of your cluster.
        Usually it looks something like "proof://HostWhereYouStartedPoDServer:XPD_PORT".
        So, the "HostWhereYouStartedPoDServer" is the host name of the machine where you started a PoD server if it is the same machine,
        where you run your analysis, than use localhost. The XPD port number you can find in pod-console's server page or by running
        "pod-server status" command.
        You can also use the PoD helper header to avoid always manually enter this URL, please see <xref linkend="A_helper_header"/>, .
