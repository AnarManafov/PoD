PoD
===

PROOF on Demand (PoD) is a tool-set, which sets up a PROOF cluster on any resource management system.
PoD is a user oriented product with an easy to use GUI and a command-line interface. It is fully automated. 
No administrative privileges or special knowledge is required to use it. 
PoD gives users, who don't have a centrally-administrated static PROOF cluster at their institutions, the possibility to enjoy the full power of interactive analysis with PROOF.
PoD is a specially designed solution to provide a PROOF cluster on the fly.
