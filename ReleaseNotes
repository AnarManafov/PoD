## 3.14 (2013-09-20)
pod: Implemented a PanDa plug-in for PoD. 
pod: Implemented a SLURM plug-in for PoD.
pod: !!!Experimental feature!!! Use identity file in ssh tunnels to connect back from WN behind FireWalls.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.9.
pod-user-defaults: learned a "pbs_plugin.options_file" option.
pod-user-defaults: learned a "slurm_plugin.upload_job_log" option.

## 3.12 (2012-10-04)
pod: User's Manual has been updated.
pod: *** Worker packages are now added as a payload to the worker script. ***
pod: PoD installations are relocatable now. The POD_LOCATION variable is set automatically according to the location of PoD_env.sh. 
pod: Added a support for BOOST 1.50 and Boost.Filesystem version3.
pod-ssh: fixed: re-pack worker package only when submitting.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.8.
pod-user-defaults: learned a "server.sandbox_dir" setting, which can be used to specify a shared location for jobs scripts which can be accessed by RMS WNs.

## v3.10 (2012-02-28) 
pod: fixed: PoD WNs can now properly detect and react when xproofd is going down or has crashed on WNs.
pod: fixed: PoD WN could hang forever if failed to start xproofd.
pod: GUI support is discontinued. (Bug 25)
pod: Implemented new gLite plug-in (Bug 26).
pod: User's Manual has been updated.
pod: Remove tmp directories on server and WNs when cleaning. (Bug 22)
pod: if xproofd on WNs goes down or is crashed, we will try to restart all processes of PoD WNs 3 times. (Bug 23)
pod: The agent restart counter is reset after a 10 min. work without interruptions.
pod-ssh: learned a "--for-worker" option to perform an action on given worker nodes. (Bug 17)
pod-ssh: The following options were dropped: "--submit", "--status", "--clean", and "--fast-clean".
pod-ssh: For user's convenience it's possible now to use commands without the "--" sign, e.g.: "pod-ssh submit" or "pod-ssh clean".
pod-remote: fixed: The command could forget to use an ssh open domain.
pod-info: fixed: A wrong PROOF connection string is shown when pod-remote is used to setup a server.

## v3.8 (2011-11-15)
pod: WN pre-compiled binaries for MacOSX are now build as universal in order to support all x86 machines and
     older MacOSX versions (the minimum supported MacOSX is 10.5).
pod: fixed: pod-ssh and pod-remote sometimes at start up erroneously complain about missing configuration files.
pod: User's Manual has been updated.
pod-info: fixed: Sometimes pod-info with "-n" or "-l" options hangs in the read method of the protocol class.
pbs-plugin: fixed: Some versions of OpenPBS require an explicit specification of the log file name, when an array job submission is used.
pbs-plugin: fixed: Site admins can forget to properly configure host keys, we therefor don't use StrictHostKeyChecking
                   when a shared home file system is not available.
pod-ssh: Users can now define an environment script for WNs in pod-ssh config files. It's so called an inline environment script.
pod-ssh: Usage of "user_worker_env.sh" in "pod-ssh" is deprecated now. Use inline environment scripts instead.
pod-ssh: learned a "--fast-clean" option to fast clean of WNs. It just shuts WNs down, but doesn't actually clean work directories.
pod-ssh: learned a "--threads/-t" option to define a number of threads in the "pod-ssh" thread pool (min is 1, max is (Cores*2). Default: 5).
pod-ssh: learned a "--exec/-e" option to execute a local shell script on the remote worker nodes.
pod-ssh: Now "--exec" can be used together with either "--submit" or "--clean" to force execution of a custom script before starting/cleaning PoD WNs.
pod-ssh: Fixed the "--submit" option. It was wrongly creating the "ssh_worker.log" file in user's home on WNs.
pod-remote: Fixed the "--stop" option.
pod-remote: The "--ssh_opt" and "--ssh_open_domain" options have been renamed to "--ssh-opt" and "--ssh-open-domain" accordingly.
pod-remote: The "--ssh-open-domain" option is fully implemented now.
pod-remote: learned a "--config/-c" option to specify an options file with the "pod-remote" command line options.
pod-remote: learned a "--env-local" and a "-env-remote" options.
pod-remote: The "--env" option has been dropped in favor to "--env-local".

## v3.6 (2011-07-07)
pod: Implemented a new command - "pod-remote". Using the command users can start/stop/restart remote PoD servers.
     The command can also be used to execute arbitrary commands on the remote PoD server, such as PoD job submissions.
     To build "pod-remote" the boost 1.41.0 (or higher) is required.
     All communications are secured and provided via SSH channels. Additionally PoD automatically creates and maintains
     SSH tunnels for PROOF connections between a user interface and PROOF muster.
     There could be problems with PROOF via SSH tunnel, see bug-fix: http://root.cern.ch/viewvc?view=rev&revision=39580 in the Revision 39580.
pod: Implemented an LoadLeveler (IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler) plug-in. This plug-in can be only used via PoD CLI.
     A special thanks to Simon Heisterkamp (Copenhagen, Denmark), who helped in development of the plug-in.
pod: Reorganize the source project by introducing some shared libs, in order to make the code to be more flexible, reusable
     and to reduce the size of executables.
pod: Users now able to add custom settings to xpd configuration file, which is generated by PoD server.
pod: PoD WN has bin ported to MacOSX (10.6).
pod: Now each PoD WN starts its own xproofd daemon.
     In this case we can control and handle each PoD worker individually (this is important for AliEn integration).
pod: The "$POD_RMS_DEFAULT_QUEUE" environment variable is now can be used to define the default RMS queue.
     If no "-q" option is provided to "pod-submit", then the value of this variable is used.
pod-info: The command can be used now to retrieve port numbers of xpd and pod-agent.
pod-ssh: The command now remembers the "--config" value if once entered. There is no need to write it again if the same when executing pod-ssh next time.
pod-ssh: The command learned "--logs" option. Download all log files from the worker nodes. Can be used only together with the "clean" option. 
pod-ssh: The command learned "--debug/-d" option. Verbose mode. Causes pod-ssh to print debugging messages about its progress. 
pod-ssh: The command has now a cleaner output. Most of the output messages are switched off and can be switched on via the "--debug" option.
pod: The build of pod-console is disabled by default. At the moment CLI is much more advanced, powerful and recommend to use over GUI.
     The GUI is being redesigned and work in progress.
pod: Updated Users's Manual.

## v3.4 (2011-02-23)
pod: Starting with version 3.4, PoD go its version numbering scheme a bit changed.
     It reflects the fact that PoD is both a production system and a research project.
     PoD now uses odd minor version numbers to denote development releases and even minor version numbers to denote stable releases.
     (see User's Manual for more details, section 3.2 "PoD Version Number Scheme").
pod: fixed [Bug 3]: pod-agent doesn't stop PoD server on Linux when idle is detected.
pod: fixed [Bug 4]: In some cases PoD server could forget to shut down xproof processes.
pod: The "pod-info" command has been rewritten from scratch.
     Now it works as a client for "pod-agent" and can be used to request information from remote PoD servers. 
     This is the first step to disentangle PoD UI and PoD Server. See User's manual for more information.
pod: PoD doesn't generate a helper header anymore, since the "pod-info" command can be used from remote (to PoD server) hosts as well.
pod: The "pod-server" command calls now the new "pod-info" to find out the status of PoD processes and ports, instead of implementing this in BASH.
     The "pod-server" is also got significant speed up improvements.
pod: The "pod-prep-worker" command checks now timestamps and diffs of the components and doesn't repack the package if the package is up-to-date.
pod: The PoD worker package is updated automatically if any of its component is updated.
     The package status is now checked automatically before submitting PoD jobs in PoD CLI and PoD SSH.
     It means, users don't need explicitly call the "pod-prep-worker" command or restart PoD server if configuration has been changed.
     But a PoD job re-submission is still required.
pod-agent: The "proofport" option has been removed. Agents are now able to detect xproofd ports automatically.
pod-agent: The admin. protocol has been upgraded to version 5.
pod-ssh: If a user doesn't request a specific number of PROOF workers for some of the worker nodes,
         then "pod-ssh" will setup PROOF workers on that worker node according to a number of CPU cores.
         That means, that the last parameter in the "pod-ssh" configuration file is not required anymore and can be left empty.
pod-user-defaults: Added the "server.proof_cfg_entry_pattern" option. This patter can be used to customize entries in proof.cfg.

## v3.1 (2011-01-07)
pod: Now PoD supports shared installations.
pod: Implemented a Condor plug-in for PoD. The plug-in supports only PoD CLI, so far. 
pod: The PoD server starter script is now much safer and smarter.
     The scrip cleans precisely only own processes, which makes it possible to start several PoD servers under the same user ID
     (this is important for AliEn integration). The script learned new algorithms, which are used to detect PoD processes and ports.
     It is also a factor of 3 faster now.
pod: The PoD worker script cleans now precisely only own processes. It makes it possible to start several different PoD workers under
     the same user ID (this is important for AliEn integration).
pod: The "pod-server" command learned "restart" and "getbins" options.
pod: User's environment script name changed from "user.worker_env.sh" to "user_worker_env.sh".
pod: The OGE plug-in was renamed to GE (Grid Engine).
pod: Stop all processes of PoD server, when pod-agent server detects idle timeout. In older versions, only pod-agent was stopped.
pod: SSH plug-in: Warn users that PoD server is not running, before "submit" is executed.
pod: SSH plug-in: Better error handling in case of "status" and "clean".
pod: This release also fixes a number of minor issues.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.7.
pod-user-defaults: renamed the oge_plugin section to ge_plugin.
pod-user-defaults: added the ge_plugin.options_file option.
pod-user-defaults: added the condor_plugin.upload_job_log option.
pod-user-defaults: added the condor_plugin.options_file option.
pod-user-defaults: "pod-user-defaults" learned the "userenvscript" option.
                   It shows the path of user's environment script of workers (if present).
pod-user-defaults: "pod-user-defaults" learned the "verbose,V" option.
                   This option causes "pod-user-defaults" to be verbose in case of an error. 

## v2.4 (2010-11-14)
pod: Implemented an Oracle Grid Engine (OGE/SGE) plug-in for PoD. This plug-in can be used via PoD GUI and CLI.
pod: Fixed a typo/bug, which prevented PoD worker to download pre-compiled binaries of pod-agent for x86 machines.
pod: Now the PoD pre-compiled worker packages naming is automated and unified.
pod: Added "pod-check-update" command.
pod: WNs don't download pre-compiled bins from the PoD central repository anymore. Now only PoD UI downloads them if missing.
     Users could also provide own binaries, instead of using the PoD central repository. This resolves several security issues and
     speeds up the start up time of PoD jobs.
pod: PoD tries to automatically detect whether PoD's server is installed on a shared home file system, which is also
     mounted on WNs.  
pod: PoD WNs now tries to use binaries from PoD UI, if a shared home file system is detected.
     It speeds up the start up time of PoD jobs. If this try fails, then PoD WN will use
     pre-compiled bins, which come with PoD's worker package.
pod: PoD UI/Server supports Mac OS X. So far only CLI and only the SSH plug-in are working and have been tested.
pod: All CLI plug-ins are now in separate files. This makes it much easer to extend PoD with new plug-ins and to support old ones.
pod: fixed behaviour for PBS and OGE plug-ins: when xxxx.upload_job_log is set to "no", there will be no jobs' output stored, even no stdout/err. 
pod: User's Manual has been updated.
pod: This release also has a number of minor fixes.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.6.
pod-user-defaults: removed the pbs_plugin.shared_home option.
pod-user-defaults: added the oge_plugin.upload_job_log option.

## v2.3 (2010-10-03)
pod: pod-ssh doesn't use scp anymore, instead rsync is used.
pod: A number of minor changes.
pod: MacOSX port. Implemented a custom pkill function, since MacOSX doesn't support pkill command.
pod-agent: MacOSX port. The agent has been slightly updated in order to support MacOSX.
pod-agent: Fixed a regression bug, which in some cases prevented Agent Clients to go out of admin-channel.
           This could blocked the packet-forwarder operations.

## v2.2 (2010-09-17)
pod: A major highlight of this release is the first implementation of the PoD with SSH plug-in (see User's Manual, Chapter 11. SSH plug-in).
pod: The project has been restructured. Now most of the submodules have been incorporated directly into PoD's source tree.
pod: A number of fixes to optimize the build process speed and the size of the source package.
pod: Added new build targets, api-docs and upload-api-docs. In order to build PoD's private API documentation.
pod: A new versioning system has been introduced. Now using a git canonical version number as a basis for PoD's version string.
pod: The User's Manual has been significantly updated and a new chapter - "Quick Start" has been added.
pod: Using a new bash algorithm, instead of a perl code to find out free tcp ports.
pod: The pod-user-defaults-lite executable (python implementation) has been removed from the project.
     The generic pod-user-defaults (C++) is used now on both sides, server and worker.
pod: PoD doesn't use xrootd anymore. Instead xproofd is used.
     Starting with ROOT version 5.24/00 an executable named xproofd is also available under  $ROOTSYS/bin.
     The xproofd executable is built out of the same main program used to build the xrootd executable. However, it loads by default
     the XrdProofdProtocol instead of the data-serving protocol XrdXrootdProtocol. The purpose of this daemon is to simplify
     the configuration when data-serving is not needed or it is handled differently.
pod: Implemented an automatic execution of a custom (user specified) environment script on workers before PoD processes start. (User's Manual, section 5.2.)
pod-agent: learned "--workers" option. A number of PROOF workers to spawn.
           Used only by agents in a worker mode and only in the native PROOF connection.
pod-agent: the internal administration protocol has been upgraded to version 3.
pod-agent: the "--pidfile/p" option has been removed. User default's "<server/worker>.work_dir" is used instead.
pod-agent: the internal-administration protocol algorithms has been improved.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.5.
pod-user-defaults: removed xrd port settings, since PoD is using the xproofd executable, instead of the xrootd executable.
pod-user-defaults: removed the worker.agent_threads setting.
pod-user-defaults: "pod-user-defaults" learned "--default/-d" option to generate the default PoD configuration file.
pod-user-defaults: "pod-user-defaults" learned "--force/-f" option, wich can be used with "--default/-d".
                   If the destination file exists, remove it and create a new file, without prompting for confirmation.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): Fixed a bug. After a reload the console shows an incorrect number of previously submitted PoD workers.

## v2.1.4 (2010-05-26)
pod: A new build system and installation procedure have been introduced.
pod: Added a PBS plug-in, which opens a possibility to submit PoD jobs to PBS resource management system.
pod: User's manual is updated.
pod: The source code of sub-modules of PoD is now shipped along with the PoD distribution. 
utilities: Added "pod-info" command. This is a part of PoD command line interface now. Please see PoD documentation for more details.
utilities: Added "pod-prep-worker" command. This is a part of PoD command line interface now. Please see PoD documentation for more details. 
utilities: Added "pod-submit" command. This is a part of PoD command line interface now. Please see PoD documentation for more details.
pod-agent: updated build system. Now can be build as a part of PoD or independently.
glite-api-wrapper: ported to gLite UI 3.2
glite-api-wrapper: use cmake as a build system
pod-console: updated build system. Now can be build as a part of PoD or independently.
pod-console: added glite-api-wrapper as a part of gLite plug-in. Using GAW v3.3.0.
pod-console: added a PBS/torque plug-in.
pod-user-defaults: updated build system. Now can be build as a part of PoD or independently.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.4
pod-user-defaults: new option <pbs_plugin.shared_home>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether a shared home files system is used.
                   If "no" is set, then PoD will use the scp command to stagin/out needed files.
pod-user-defaults: new option <pbs_plugin.upload_job_log>, default if "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether to upload jobs log files from workers
                   when PoD jobs are completed. Jobs log files include a full log of PROOF,
                   XROOTD and pod-agent's log files. 

## v2.1.3 (2010-01-18)
pod-agent: implemented a new internal communication protocol. It's used for Client/Server admin. communications.
pod-agent: now it is possible to use a direct connection between a PROOF server and PROOF workers.
           Agent can automatically decided whether to use packet forwarding (for cases when PROOF workers are behind a firewall) or not.
           It is also a configurable option in the PoD user defaults. To use this feature you need to have ROOT 5.25.04 or higher.
pod-agent: minimally required version of ROOT is 5.25.04. Otherwise agent will not be able to detect idle when a native PROOF connection is used.
pod-agent: minimally required version of Boost is 1.33.1 now.
pod-agent: added unit tests.
pod-agent: the log file name now is "pod-agent.<instance_name>.log".
pod-console: lock-on-idle time is 30 minutes now (instead of 15 min.).
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.3
pod-user-defaults: new option <server.packet_forwarding>, default is "auto".
                   if workers are behind a firewall then PoD will use its packet forwarding (PF) algorithms
                   to maintain the PROOF traffic between server and workers.
                   By setting this key to "yes" you force PoD to use PF in any case. If "auto" is set then PoD
                   will decide on the fly whether to use PF for each worker individually based on the possibility
                   to directly connect to worker.

## v2.1.2 (2009-11-30)
utilities: The automatic port mapping: increase a retry counts to 10 instead of 3.
           Sometime xrd could take longer to start which prevents PoD workers to properly detect all ports of it.
           As the result these workers will shutdown the job at a very early stages of initialization of PoD.
utilities: use user defaults' work_dir as a working dir value in the PoD server script.
utilities: Server_PoD.sh has been renamed to pod-server.
pod-agent: create admin files by the server/worker.work_dir path. For example, AFS doesn't support named pipes,
           users therefore can install PoD on AFS but specify different work_dir where PoD is able to create pipes and other admin files.
pod-agent: minor improvements of packet-forwarding algorithms.
pod-console: switch the whole monitoring and all sensors off if there is no user interaction during the last 15 min (time is hard coded).
pod-console: GUI modifications. Removed PID dir controls from the server page.
pod-console: introduced an improved algorithm of updating available PROOF workers (WORKERS page).
             Is not timer based anymore, but rather watches file modifications system events. Now very efficient and system resource friendly.
pod-console: fixed a case when after restart the console could forget a number of expected PROOF workers.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): moved to Qt 4.4.2, because of the bug in Qt 4.2.1 (see. http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2007-02/thread00018-0.html,
                           "Resetting a sub-tree of a QAbstractItemModel").
pod-console (LSF plug-in): *** revised implementation of the LSF plug-in engine. That made the LSF plug-in very much LSF and resource friendly. ***
pod-console (LSF plug-in): a number of requests to LSF daemon (a very expensive operations) and cases when requests should be send have been reduced by
                           a huge factor and the algorithm now is much faster and smarter.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): update status only for unfinished LSF jobs.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): the serialization file of the LSF plug-in has been renamed to "pod-console_LSF.xml.cfg".
pod-console (LSF plug-in): improved the update speed of the jobs tree (GUI) if a job was removes from the monitoring or added to it.
                           Now this part of GUI is more responsive and fast.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): fixed a SEGFAULT error condition, which could happen when closing pod-console or removing jobs from the monitoring.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): now users can send a kill signal to a LSF job or to an job in the array, using jobs context menu.
                           This will kill the job and remove it from the LSF queue.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): now user can exclude all completed jobs at once from the monitoring, using jobs context menu.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): new user defaults option <lsf_plugin.email_job_output>.
                           It specifies whether job's output is sent to the user by mail or should be
                           written to files. Output files are saved in to PoD's log dir.
pod-conosle (LSF plug-in): in the jobs tree view (GUI), expand only one parent node at time.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): don't count completed LSF jobs as expected PROOF worker.
                           It helps the WORKERS page in GUI to show a number of expected workers properly.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.2
pod-user-defaults: if shared home is used, users can define $ROOTSYS as a ROOT version for workers.
                   Workers will use that version of ROOT, which is defined on UI machine. (see worker.my_rootsys in PoD.cfg)
pod-user-defaults: new option <lsf_plugin.email_job_output>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether job's output is sent to the user by mail.
                   If no is set, output will be delivered the log directory in std_[INDEX].err and std_[INDEX].out files
pod-user-defaults: new option <lsf_plugin.upload_job_log>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether to upload jobs log files from workers when PoD jobs are completed.
                   Jobs log files include a full log of PROOF, XROOTD and pod-agent's log files.

## v2.1.1 (2009-10-24)
- using a central user-defaults configuration ($POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg). 
- a general optimization has been done. A virt. Memory footprint is reduced by a factor of 14 (in case of 80 WNs). A significant increase of the speed.
- added idle time-out watchers for servers and workers. Shutdown a node (a worker or a server) when idle for a defined amount of time.
- server's script has been cleaned up and now also relays on PoD's user defaults.
- jobs' wrapper script has been cleaned up.
- introduced a new algorithm for automatic port mapping.

Configuration update:
   - added <worker.set_my_rootsys>. Set to "yes" if you want to use a custom version of the ROOT on workers. PoD set ROOTSYS env.variable to a value defined by <worker.my_rootsys>.
   - added <worker.my_rootsys>. Set to a path to a custom ROOT version.

Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== pod-agent v2.1.1 (2009-10-20) with the following changes:
   - project's has been renamed to pod-agent.
   - use now PoD's user defaults ($POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg) for configuration options.
   - a new proxy machinery based on a thread-pool pattern. This gives PoD a significant speed improvements in cases when PROOF does file validation and merging and when many workers are used.
   - a number of threads in the pool and a read buffer size can be changed via PoD's user defaults configuration file. 
   - when in the worker mode, use a server_info.cfg file, where a host name and a port number of the agent server are stored.
   - added new program options: 
      - "proofport" - a PROOF (xproof) port. Used only by agents in a worker mode
      - "serverinfo" - a server info file name. Default is $POD_LOCATION/etc/server_info.cfg
   - support Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.
   - a log level is now can be defined via PoD's user defaults configuration file.
   - a log file location is now can be defined via Pod's user defaults configuration file.
=== pod-console v1.1.1 (2009-10-20) with the following changes:
   - Renamed to pod-console.
   - Don't update server or workers page if the page is hidden.
   - Optimized LSF plug-in status updated.
   - A factor of 3 optimization of the server status update.
   - minor bugs fixes.
=== pod-user-defaults v1.0.1 (2009-10-20)

## v2.0.10 (2009-07-21)
Using new PROOFAgent.
   - A patch release.
     The patch addresses some stability issues and most importantly fixes a hanging-on-merging issue, which was due to a loose of TCP packages.
     Workers where sending data without checking that server could be temporary unavailable due to a full buffer of the socket.

## v2.0.9 (2009-07-11)
- A patched version, tuned for ROOT 5.24. Released because PROOF changed the way it handles variables in xrd config. file.

## v2.0.8 (2009-06-16)
- Switch to $POD_LOCATION instead of $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION.
- Using PROOFAgent's new configuration file.
- A better handling of multiple PoD workers on the same worker node started in the same time.
- Many minor fixes.
Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== PROOFAgent v2.0.0 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Dramatically reduced a number of threads, which PA produces (on both server and client sides).
   - A slight redesign of the packet forwarder. PA now requires a factor of 3 less resources to handle each worker.
   - Removed the dependency on XERCES-C library.
   - The configuration file has been redesigned. Now using an INI style.
   - The build system has been switched from GNU Autotools to cmake.
   - Due to many bugs in FindBOOST of older versions of cmake we require cmake 2.6.4.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - New configuration parameter - client.shutdown_if_idle_for_sec. Shut down a worker if its idle time is higher than this value.
   - Cosmetic changes.
=== PAConsole v1.0.7 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Source code cleaning.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - Using new PROOFAgent's configuration file.
   - Fixed a case when several users run a PoD server and PAConsole couldn't recognize properly whether PoD runs or not.
   - LSF plug-in:
      * use LSF's queue information to limit the maximum number of workers in GUI.

## v2.0.7 (2009-04-30)
- project has been renamed to "PROOF on Demand" (PoD).
- PAConsole now supports job manager plug-ins. Currently gLite and LSF plug-ins are officially supported.
- supporting LSF plug-in an workers on LSF.
- dynamic ports configuration is now sopported on PoD workers and server. PoD chooses ports for XRD, XPROOF and PROOFAgent on the fly during the start of the server of workers.
- cosmetic changes.
- using GAW v.3.2.0, PROOFAgent 1.0.5 and PAConsole 1.0.6 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

## v2.0.6 (2008-09-02)
- this version is based on ROOT 5.18 (see: workers are dropped if use ROOT 5.20 or ROOT 5.21.02 - [Trac Ticket #72] )
- implemented a part of [Trac Ticket #53].
  Since r1963 there is a possibility to use xrootd pools on WNs.
  When users can't use external xrootd clusters or any other data source,
  they may want to use local WNs as pools. In this case gLitePROOF makes UI
  as a redirector and all connected workers as servers. And one can use xrdcp
  to distribute data files on the cluster. Example:
     xrdcp dstarmb0.root root://depc218.gsi.de:20094//tmp/
  Where depc218.gsi.de - is a gLitePROOF UI and 20094 is a port for xrootd (1094 - is a default one).
  In the current implementation there is only one major restriction, that a port,
  which the user has assigned for xrootd should be opened on WNs.
  In the next version of PROOFAgent there will a proxy provided,
  so that this restriction will be voided.
- documentation has been updated.
- minor bugs have been fixed.
- Added an ability to download a PROOF log files from worker nodes. [Trac Ticket #77]
- using GAW v.3.2.0.1974, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.5.1977 and PAConsole 1.0.5 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

## v2.0.5 (2008-06-13)
- gLitePROOF.sh - a grid job script, its error and signal handling has been improved [Trac Ticket #52].
- added the latest PAConsole.
- documentation has been updated.
- using GAW v.3.1.0.1880, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.4.1883 and PAConsole 1.0.4 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).
