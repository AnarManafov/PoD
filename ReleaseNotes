********************* Release 1.2.2 not yet released ************************
pod-console: adapt the project to be build also as a sub-project in PoD.

********************* Release 1.2.1 2010-01-18 ************************
pod-console: lock-on-idle time is 30 minutes now (instead of 15 min.).

********************* Release 1.2.0 2009-11-28 ************************
pod-console: switch the whole monitoring and all sensors off if there is no user interaction during the last 15 min (time is hard coded).
pod-console: GUI modifications. Removed PID dir controls from the server page.
pod-console: introduced an improved algorithm of updating available PROOF workers (WORKERS page).
             Is not timer based anymore, but rather watches file modifications system events. Now very efficient and system resource friendly.
pod-console: fixed a case when after restart the console could forget a number of expected PROOF workers.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): moved to Qt 4.4.2, because of the bug in Qt 4.2.1 (see. http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2007-02/thread00018-0.html,
                           "Resetting a sub-tree of a QAbstractItemModel").
pod-console (LSF plug-in): *** revised implementation of the LSF plug-in engine. That made the LSF plug-in very much LSF and resource friendly. ***
pod-console (LSF plug-in): a number of requests to LSF daemon (a very expensive operations) and cases when requests should be send have been reduced by
                           a huge factor and the algorithm now is much faster and smarter.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): update status only for unfinished LSF jobs. 
pod-console (LSF plug-in): the serialization file of the LSF plug-in has been renamed to "pod-console_LSF.xml.cfg".
pod-console (LSF plug-in): improved the update speed of the jobs tree (GUI) if a job was removes from the monitoring or added to it.
                           Now this part of GUI is more responsive and fast.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): fixed a SEGFAULT error condition, which could happen when closing pod-console or removing jobs from the monitoring.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): now users can send a kill signal to a LSF job or to an job in the array, using jobs context menu.
                           This will kill the job and remove it from the LSF queue.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): now user can exclude all completed jobs at once from the monitoring, using jobs context menu.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): new user defaults option <lsf_plugin.email_job_output>. It specifies whether job's output is sent to the user by mail or should be
                           written to files. Output files are saved in to PoD's log dir.
pod-conosle (LSF plug-in): in the jobs tree view (GUI), expand only one parent node at time.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): don't count completed LSF jobs as expected PROOF worker. It helps the WORKERS page in GUI to show a number of expected workers properly.

********************* Release 1.1.1 2009-10-20 ************************
- Renamed to pod-console.
- Don't update server or workers page if the page is hidden.
- Optimized LSF plug-in status updated.
- A factor of 3 optimization of the server status update.
- minor bugs fixes.

********************* Release 1.0.7 2009-06-15 ************************
- Source code cleaning.
- Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
- Using new PROOFAgent's configuration file.
- Fixed a case when several users run a PoD server and PAConsole couldn't recognize properly whether PoD runs or not.
- LSF plug-in:
   * use LSF's queue information to limit the maximum number of workers in GUI.

********************* Release 1.0.6 2009-04-30 ************************
- using new build system - cmake [Trac Ticket #79]
- implemented plug-in system for PAConsole's job managers [Trac Ticket #80]
- implemented gLite job manager plug-in [Trac Ticket #80]
- implemented LSF job manager plug-in [Trac Ticket #81]

********************* Release 1.0.5 2008-08-30 ************************
- The project has been moved to Eclipse 3.4 "Ganymede".
- Fixed many typos.
- Show message box if PAConsole user submits jobs but server is not running [Trac Ticket #70].
- Added a possibility to retrieve jobs logging information from the gLite LB.
  Now using a context menu of the Grid jobs list one can get a full log of the selected job. [Track Ticket #65]
- It is now possible to submit (with different jdl files) and monitor several jobs simultaneously.
  Parametric jobs (gLitePROOF default jdl) monitored as well.
  Every time user clicks the submit button a new job will be submitted and added to the monitoring.
  In this case users can add more workers to a gLitePROOF cluster on the fly and keep tracking all of them.
  Users also can remove job from monitoring using context menu of the jobs list control.
  Remove is not supported for children jobs, only single jobs or parents can be removed from the monitoring. [Track Ticket #71]
- Optimizations in jobs' monitoring, which led to reductions of calls to gLite LB.
- Added a Preferences page. Users now are able to adjust PAConsole settings. Currently the following settings are available:
  * Job Status update interval
  * Workers update interval
  more will come... [Track Ticket #73].
- PAConsole wasn't using the defined jdl file, if a user changed jdl file name manually (without Browse button).
- GUI fixes.
- Minor bugs fixing.

********************* Release 1.0.4 2008-06-13 ************************

- Added a context menu item (Grid page), using which one can retrieve job
  output files of the selected job [Trac Ticket #48].
- Now PAConsole supports serialization [Trac Ticket #47].
  It remembers users settings and, for example, the last submitted job saved too.
  Which allows user to restart PAConsole and still monitor the last job.
  Configuration data saved to and loaded from  $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION/etc/proofagent.cfg.xml.
- ReleaseNotes should be a part of distr [Trac Ticket #61].
