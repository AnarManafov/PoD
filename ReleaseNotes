                   The parameter specifies whether a shared home files system is used.
                   If "no" is set, than PoD will use the scp command to stagin/out needed files.
pod-user-defaults: new option <pbs_plugin.upload_job_log>, default if "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether to upload jobs log files from workers
                   when PoD jobs are completed. Jobs log files include a full log of PROOF,
                   XROOTD and pod-agent's log files. 

## v.1.0.3 (2010-01-18)
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.3
pod-user-defaults: new option <server.packet_forwarding>, default is "auto".
                   if workers are behind a firewall than PoD will use its packet forwarding (PF) algorithms
                   to maintain the PROOF traffic between server and workers.
                   By setting this key to "yes" you force PoD to use PF in any case. If "auto" is set than PoD
                   will decide on the fly whether to use PF for each worker individually based on the possibility
                   to directly connect to worker.

                   Workers will use that version of ROOT, which is defined on UI machine. (see worker.my_rootsys in PoD.cfg)
pod-user-defaults: new option <lsf_plugin.email_job_output>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether job's output is sent to the user by mail.
                   If no is set, output will be delivered the log directory in std_[INDEX].err and std_[INDEX].out files
pod-user-defaults: new option <lsf_plugin.upload_job_log>, default is "no".
