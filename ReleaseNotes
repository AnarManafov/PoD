********************* Release 2.1.0 not yet released ************************

- new program options:

	- "serverinfo" - a server info file name. Default is $POD_LOCATION/etc/server_info.cfg
	- "workdir" - Agent's working directory. Agent will use this value if provided instead of PoD's configuration file options.

********************* Release 2.0.1 2009-07-21 ************************
A patch release.
The patch addresses some stability issues and most importantly fixes a hanging-on-merging issue, which was due to a loose of TCP packages.
Workers where sending data without checking that server could be temporary unavailable due to a full buffer of the socket.

********************* Release 2.0.0 2009-06-15 ************************
- Dramatically reduced a number of threads, which PA produces (on both server and client sides).
- Slight redesign of the packet forwarder. PA now requires a factor of 3 less resources to handle each worker.
- Removed the dependency on XERCES-C library.
- The configuration file has been redesigned. Now using an INI style.
- The build system has been switched from GNU Autotools to cmake.
- Due to many bugs in FindBOOST of older versions of cmake we require cmake 2.6.4.
- Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
- New configuration parameter - client.shutdown_if_idle_for_sec. Shut down a worker if its idle time is higher than this value.
- Cosmetic changes.

********************* Release 1.0.5 2008-08-20 ************************

- The project has been moved to Eclipse 3.4 "Ganymede".

********************* Release 1.0.4 2008-06-13 ************************
