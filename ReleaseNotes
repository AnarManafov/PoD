# Release Notes for PoD (PROOF on Demand)

## v2.2 (2010-09-17)
pod: A major highlite of this release is the first implementation of the PoD with SSH plug-in (see User's Manual, Chapter 11. SSH plug-in).
pod: The project has been restructured. Now most of the submodules have been incorporated directly into PoD's source tree.
pod: A number of fixes to optimize the build process speed and the size of the source package.
pod: Added new build targets, api-docs and upload-api-docs. In order to build PoD's private API documentation.
pod: A new versioning system has been introduced. Now using a git canonical version number as a basis for PoD's version string.
pod: The User's Manual has been significatly updated and a new chapter - "Quick Start" has been added.
pod: Using a new bash algorithm, instead of a perl code to find out free tcp ports.
pod: The pod-user-defaults-lite executable (python implementation) has been removed from the project.
     The generic pod-user-defaults (C++) is used now on both sides, server and worker.
pod: PoD doesn't use xrootd anymore. Instead xproofd is used.
     Starting with ROOT version 5.24/00 an executable named xproofd is also available under  $ROOTSYS/bin.
     The xproofd executable is build out of the same main program used to build the xrootd executable. However, it loads by default
     the XrdProofdProtocol instead of the data-serving protocol XrdXrootdProtocol. The purpose of this daemon is to simplify
     the configuration when data-serving is not needed or it is handled differently.
pod: Implemented an automatic execution of a custom (user specified) environment script on workers before PoD processes start. (User's Manual, section 5.2.)
pod-agent: learned "--workers" option. A number of PROOF workers to spawn.
           Used only by agents in a worker mode and only in the native PROOF connection.
pod-agent: the internal administration protocol has been upgraded to version 3.
pod-agent: the "--pidfile/p" option has been removed. User default's "<server/worker>.work_dir" is used instead.
pod-agent: the internal-administration protocol algorithms has been improoved.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.5.
pod-user-defaults: removed xrd port settings, since PoD is using the xproofd executable, instead of the xrootd executable.
pod-user-defaults: removed the worker.agent_threads setting.
pod-user-defaults: "pod-user-defaults" learned "--default/-d" option to generate the default PoD configuration file.
pod-user-defaults: "pod-user-defaults" learned "--force/-f" option, wich can be used with "--default/-d".
                   If the destination file exists, remove it and create a new file, without prompting for confirmation.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): Fixed a bug. After a reload the console shows an incorrect number of previously submitted PoD workers.

## v2.1.4 (2010-05-26)
pod: A new build system and installation procedure have been introduced.
pod: Added a PBS plug-in, which opens a possibility to submit PoD jobs to PBS resource management system.
pod: User's manual is updated.
pod: The source code of sub-modules of PoD is now shipped along with the PoD distribution. 
utilities: Added "pod-info" command. This is a part of PoD command line interface now. Please see PoD documentation for more details.
utilities: Added "pod-prep-worker" command. This is a part of PoD command line interface now. Please see PoD documentation for more details. 
utilities: Added "pod-submit" command. This is a part of PoD command line interface now. Please see PoD documentation for more details.
pod-agent: updated build system. Now can be build as a part of PoD or independently.
glite-api-wrapper: ported to gLite UI 3.2
glite-api-wrapper: use cmake as a build system
pod-console: updated build system. Now can be build as a part of PoD or independently.
pod-console: added glite-api-wrapper as a part of gLite plug-in. Using GAW v3.3.0.
pod-console: added a PBS/torque plug-in.
pod-user-defaults: updated build system. Now can be build as a part of PoD or independently.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.4
pod-user-defaults: new option <pbs_plugin.shared_home>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether a shared home files system is used.
                   If "no" is set, than PoD will use the scp command to stagin/out needed files.
pod-user-defaults: new option <pbs_plugin.upload_job_log>, default if "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether to upload jobs log files from workers
                   when PoD jobs are completed. Jobs log files include a full log of PROOF,
                   XROOTD and pod-agent's log files. 

## v2.1.3 (2010-01-18)
pod-agent: implemented a new internal communication protocol. It's used for Client/Server admin. communications.
pod-agent: now it is possible to use a direct connection between a PROOF server and PROOF workers.
           Agent can automatically decided whether to use packet forwarding (for cases when PROOF workers are behind a firewall) or not.
           It is also a configurable option in the PoD user defaults. To use this feature you need to have ROOT 5.25.04 or higher.
pod-agent: minimally required version of ROOT is 5.25.04. Otherwise agent will not be able to detect idle when a native PROOF connection is used.
pod-agent: minimally required version of Boost is 1.33.1 now.
pod-agent: added unit tests.
pod-agent: the log file name now is "pod-agent.<instance_name>.log".
pod-console: lock-on-idle time is 30 minutes now (instead of 15 min.).
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.3
pod-user-defaults: new option <server.packet_forwarding>, default is "auto".
                   if workers are behind a firewall than PoD will use its packet forwarding (PF) algorithms
                   to maintain the PROOF traffic between server and workers.
                   By setting this key to "yes" you force PoD to use PF in any case. If "auto" is set than PoD
                   will decide on the fly whether to use PF for each worker individually based on the possibility
                   to directly connect to worker.

## v2.1.2 (2009-11-30)
utilities: The automatic port mapping: increase a retry counts to 10 instead of 3.
           Sometime xrd could take longer to start which prevents PoD workers to properly detect all ports of it.
           As the result these workers will shutdown the job at a very early stages of initialization of PoD.
utilities: use user defaults' work_dir as a working dir value in the PoD server script.
utilities: Server_PoD.sh has been renamed to pod-server.
pod-agent: create admin files by the server/worker.work_dir path. For example, AFS doesn't support named pipes,
           users therefore can install PoD on AFS but specify different work_dir where PoD is able to create pipes and other admin files.
pod-agent: minor improvements of packet-forwarding algorithms.
pod-console: switch the whole monitoring and all sensors off if there is no user interaction during the last 15 min (time is hard coded).
pod-console: GUI modifications. Removed PID dir controls from the server page.
pod-console: introduced an improved algorithm of updating available PROOF workers (WORKERS page).
             Is not timer based anymore, but rather watches file modifications system events. Now very efficient and system resource friendly.
pod-console: fixed a case when after restart the console could forget a number of expected PROOF workers.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): moved to Qt 4.4.2, because of the bug in Qt 4.2.1 (see. http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2007-02/thread00018-0.html,
                           "Resetting a sub-tree of a QAbstractItemModel").
pod-console (LSF plug-in): *** revised implementation of the LSF plug-in engine. That made the LSF plug-in very much LSF and resource friendly. ***
pod-console (LSF plug-in): a number of requests to LSF daemon (a very expensive operations) and cases when requests should be send have been reduced by
                           a huge factor and the algorithm now is much faster and smarter.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): update status only for unfinished LSF jobs.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): the serialization file of the LSF plug-in has been renamed to "pod-console_LSF.xml.cfg".
pod-console (LSF plug-in): improved the update speed of the jobs tree (GUI) if a job was removes from the monitoring or added to it.
                           Now this part of GUI is more responsive and fast.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): fixed a SEGFAULT error condition, which could happen when closing pod-console or removing jobs from the monitoring.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): now users can send a kill signal to a LSF job or to an job in the array, using jobs context menu.
                           This will kill the job and remove it from the LSF queue.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): now user can exclude all completed jobs at once from the monitoring, using jobs context menu.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): new user defaults option <lsf_plugin.email_job_output>.
                           It specifies whether job's output is sent to the user by mail or should be
                           written to files. Output files are saved in to PoD's log dir.
pod-conosle (LSF plug-in): in the jobs tree view (GUI), expand only one parent node at time.
pod-console (LSF plug-in): don't count completed LSF jobs as expected PROOF worker.
                           It helps the WORKERS page in GUI to show a number of expected workers properly.
pod-user-defaults: updated user defaults configuration file - v0.2
pod-user-defaults: if shared home is used, users can define $ROOTSYS as a ROOT version for workers.
                   Workers will use that version of ROOT, which is defined on UI machine. (see worker.my_rootsys in PoD.cfg)
pod-user-defaults: new option <lsf_plugin.email_job_output>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether job's output is sent to the user by mail.
                   If no is set, output will be delivered the log directory in std_[INDEX].err and std_[INDEX].out files
pod-user-defaults: new option <lsf_plugin.upload_job_log>, default is "no".
                   The parameter specifies whether to upload jobs log files from workers when PoD jobs are completed.
                   Jobs log files include a full log of PROOF, XROOTD and pod-agent's log files.

## v2.1.1 (2009-10-24)
- using a central user-defaults configuration ($POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg). 
- a general optimization has been done. A virt. Memory footprint is reduced by a factor of 14 (in case of 80 WNs). A significant increase of the speed.
- added idle time-out watchers for servers and workers. Shutdown a node (a worker or a server) when idle for a defined amount of time.
- server's script has been cleaned up and now also relays on PoD's user defaults.
- jobs' wrapper script has been cleaned up.
- introduced a new algorithm for automatic port mapping.

Configuration update:
   - added <worker.set_my_rootsys>. Set to "yes" if you want to use a custom version of the ROOT on workers. PoD set ROOTSYS env.variable to a value defined by <worker.my_rootsys>.
   - added <worker.my_rootsys>. Set to a path to a custom ROOT version.

Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== pod-agent v2.1.1 (2009-10-20) with the following changes:
   - project's has been renamed to pod-agent.
   - use now PoD's user defaults ($POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg) for configuration options.
   - a new proxy machinery based on a thread-pool pattern. This gives PoD a significant speed improvements in cases when PROOF does file validation and merging and when many workers are used.
   - a number of threads in the pool and a read buffer size can be changed via PoD's user defaults configuration file. 
   - when in the worker mode, use a server_info.cfg file, where a host name and a port number of the agent server are stored.
   - added new program options: 
      - "proofport" - a PROOF (xproof) port. Used only by agents in a worker mode
      - "serverinfo" - a server info file name. Default is $POD_LOCATION/etc/server_info.cfg
   - support Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.
   - a log level is now can be defined via PoD's user defaults configuration file.
   - a log file location is now can be defined via Pod's user defaults configuration file.
=== pod-console v1.1.1 (2009-10-20) with the following changes:
   - Renamed to pod-console.
   - Don't update server or workers page if the page is hidden.
   - Optimized LSF plug-in status updated.
   - A factor of 3 optimization of the server status update.
   - minor bugs fixes.
=== pod-user-defaults v1.0.1 (2009-10-20)

## v2.0.10 (2009-07-21)
Using new PROOFAgent.
   - A patch release.
     The patch addresses some stability issues and most importantly fixes a hanging-on-merging issue, which was due to a loose of TCP packages.
     Workers where sending data without checking that server could be temporary unavailable due to a full buffer of the socket.

## v2.0.9 (2009-07-11)
- A patched version, tuned for ROOT 5.24. Released because PROOF changed the way it handles variables in xrd config. file.

## v2.0.8 (2009-06-16)
- Switch to $POD_LOCATION instead of $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION.
- Using PROOFAgent's new configuration file.
- A better handling of multiple PoD workers on the same worker node started in the same time.
- Many minor fixes.
Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== PROOFAgent v2.0.0 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Dramatically reduced a number of threads, which PA produces (on both server and client sides).
   - A slight redesign of the packet forwarder. PA now requires a factor of 3 less resources to handle each worker.
   - Removed the dependency on XERCES-C library.
   - The configuration file has been redesigned. Now using an INI style.
   - The build system has been switched from GNU Autotools to cmake.
   - Due to many bugs in FindBOOST of older versions of cmake we require cmake 2.6.4.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - New configuration parameter - client.shutdown_if_idle_for_sec. Shut down a worker if its idle time is higher than this value.
   - Cosmetic changes.
=== PAConsole v1.0.7 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Source code cleaning.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - Using new PROOFAgent's configuration file.
   - Fixed a case when several users run a PoD server and PAConsole couldn't recognize properly whether PoD runs or not.
   - LSF plug-in:
      * use LSF's queue information to limit the maximum number of workers in GUI.

## v2.0.7 (2009-04-30)
- project has been renamed to "PROOF on Demand" (PoD).
- PAConsole now supports job manager plug-ins. Currently gLite and LSF plug-ins are officially supported.
- supporting LSF plug-in an workers on LSF.
- dynamic ports configuration is now sopported on PoD workers and server. PoD chooses ports for XRD, XPROOF and PROOFAgent on the fly during the start of the server of workers.
- cosmetic changes.
- using GAW v.3.2.0, PROOFAgent 1.0.5 and PAConsole 1.0.6 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

## v2.0.6 (2008-09-02)
- this version is based on ROOT 5.18 (see: workers are dropped if use ROOT 5.20 or ROOT 5.21.02 - [Trac Ticket #72] )
- implemented a part of [Trac Ticket #53].
  Since r1963 there is a possibility to use xrootd pools on WNs.
  When users can't use external xrootd clusters or any other data source,
  they may want to use local WNs as pools. In this case gLitePROOF makes UI
  as a redirector and all connected workers as servers. And one can use xrdcp
  to distribute data files on the cluster. Example:
     xrdcp dstarmb0.root root://depc218.gsi.de:20094//tmp/
  Where depc218.gsi.de - is a gLitePROOF UI and 20094 is a port for xrootd (1094 - is a default one).
  In the current implementation there is only one major restriction, that a port,
  which the user has assigned for xrootd should be opened on WNs.
  In the next version of PROOFAgent there will a proxy provided,
  so that this restriction will be voided.
- documentation has been updated.
- minor bugs have been fixed.
- Added an ability to download a PROOF log files from worker nodes. [Trac Ticket #77]
- using GAW v.3.2.0.1974, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.5.1977 and PAConsole 1.0.5 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

## v2.0.5 (2008-06-13)
- gLitePROOF.sh - a grid job script, its error and signal handling has been improved [Trac Ticket #52].
- added the latest PAConsole.
- documentation has been updated.
- using GAW v.3.1.0.1880, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.4.1883 and PAConsole 1.0.4 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).
