********************* Release 2.1.0 not yet released ************************
- using a central user-defaults configuration
Configuration update:
   - added <worker.set_my_rootsys>. Set to "yes" if you want to use a custom version of the ROOT on workers. PoD set ROOTSYS env.variable to a value defined by <worker.my_rootsys>.
   - added <worker.my_rootsys>. Set to a path to a custom ROOT version.

********************* Release 2.0.9 2009-07-11 ************************
- A patched version, tuned for ROOT 5.24. Released because PROOF changed the way it handles variables in xr
d config file.

********************* Release 2.0.8 2009-06-16 ************************
- Switch to $POD_LOCATION instead of $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION.
- Using PROOFAgent's new configuration file.
- A better handling of multiple PoD workers on the same worker node started in the same time.
- Many minor fixes.
Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== PROOFAgent v2.0.0 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Dramatically reduced a number of threads, which PA produces (on both server and client sides).
   - A slight redesign of the packet forwarder. PA now requires a factor of 3 less resources to handle each worker.
   - Removed the dependency on XERCES-C library.
   - The configuration file has been redesigned. Now using an INI style.
   - The build system has been switched from GNU Autotools to cmake.
   - Due to many bugs in FindBOOST of older versions of cmake we require cmake 2.6.4.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - New configuration parameter - client.shutdown_if_idle_for_sec. Shut down a worker if its idle time is higher than this value.
   - Cosmetic changes.
=== PAConsole v1.0.7 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Source code cleaning.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - Using new PROOFAgent's configuration file.
   - Fixed a case when several users run a PoD server and PAConsole couldn't recognize properly whether PoD runs or not.
   - LSF plug-in:
      * use LSF's queue information to limit the maximum number of workers in GUI.

********************* Release 2.0.7 2009-04-30 ************************
- project has been renamed to "PROOF on Demand" (PoD).
- PAConsole now supports job manager plug-ins. Currently gLite and LSF plug-ins are officially supported.
- supporting LSF plug-in an workers on LSF.
- dynamic ports configuration is now sopported on PoD workers and server. PoD chooses ports for XRD, XPROOF and PROOFAgent on the fly during the start of the server of workers.
- cosmetic changes.
- using GAW v.3.2.0, PROOFAgent 1.0.5 and PAConsole 1.0.6 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

********************* Release 2.0.6 2008-09-02 ************************

- this version is based on ROOT 5.18 (see: workers are dropped if use ROOT 5.20 or ROOT 5.21.02 - [Trac Ticket #72] )
- implemented a part of [Trac Ticket #53].
  Since r1963 there is a possibility to use xrootd pools on WNs.
  When users can't use external xrootd clusters or any other data source,
  they may want to use local WNs as pools. In this case gLitePROOF makes UI
  as a redirector and all connected workers as servers. And one can use xrdcp
  to distribute data files on the cluster. Example:
     xrdcp dstarmb0.root root://depc218.gsi.de:20094//tmp/
  Where depc218.gsi.de - is a gLitePROOF UI and 20094 is a port for xrootd (1094 - is a default one).
  In the current implementation there is only one major restriction, that a port,
  which the user has assigned for xrootd should be opened on WNs.
  In the next version of PROOFAgent there will a proxy provided,
  so that this restriction will be voided.
- documentation has been updated.
- minor bugs have been fixed.
- Added an ability to download a PROOF log files from worker nodes. [Trac Ticket #77]
- using GAW v.3.2.0.1974, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.5.1977 and PAConsole 1.0.5 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

********************* Release 2.0.5 2008-06-13 ************************

- gLitePROOF.sh - a grid job script, its error and signal handling has been improved [Trac Ticket #52].
- added the latest PAConsole.
- documentation has been updated.
- using GAW v.3.1.0.1880, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.4.1883 and PAConsole 1.0.4 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).
