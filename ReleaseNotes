********************* Release 2.0.6 2008-09-02 ************************

- this version is based on ROOT 5.18 (see: workers are dropped if use ROOT 5.20 or ROOT 5.21.02 - [Trac Ticket #72] )
- implemented a part of [Trac Ticket #53].
  Since r1963 there is a possibility to use xrootd pools on WNs.
  When users can't use external xrootd clusters or any other data source,
  they may want to use local WNs as pools. In this case gLitePROOF makes UI
  as a redirector and all connected workers as servers. And one can use xrdcp
  to distribute data files on the cluster. Example:
     xrdcp dstarmb0.root root://depc218.gsi.de:20094//tmp/
  Where depc218.gsi.de - is a gLitePROOF UI and 20094 is a port for xrootd (1094 - is a default one).
  In the current implementation there is only one major restriction, that a port,
  which the user has assigned for xrootd should be opened on WNs.
  In the next version of PROOFAgent there will a proxy provided,
  so that this restriction will be voided.
- documentation has been updated.
- minor bugs have been fixed.
- Added an ability to download a PROOF log files from worker nodes. [Trac Ticket #77]
