********************* Release 2.1.2 not yet released ************************
- create admin files by the server/worker.work_dir path. For example, AFS doesn't support named pipes,
  users therefore can install PoD on AFS but specify different work_dir where PoD is able to create pipes and other admin files.
- minor improvements of packet-forwarding algorithms.
  
********************* Release 2.1.1 2009-10-20 ************************
- project's has been renamed to pod-agent.
- use now PoD's user defaults ( $POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg) for configuration options.
- a new proxy machinery based on a thread-pool pattern. This gives PoD a significant speed improvements in cases when PROOF does file validation and merging and when many workers are used.
- a number of threads in the pool and a read buffer size can be changed via PoD's user defaults configuration file. 
- when in the worker mode, use a server_info.cfg file, where a host name and a port number of the agent server are stored.
- added new program options: 
    - "proofport" - a PROOF (xproof) port. Used only by agents in a worker mode
    - "serverinfo" - a server info file name. Default is $POD_LOCATION/etc/server_info.cfg
- support Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.
- a log level is now can be defined via PoD's user defaults configuration file.
- a log file location is now can be defined via Pod's user defaults configuration file.

********************* Release 2.0.1 2009-07-21 ************************
A patch release.
The patch addresses some stability issues and most importantly fixes a hanging-on-merging issue, which was due to a loose of TCP packages.
Workers where sending data without checking that server could be temporary unavailable due to a full buffer of the socket.

********************* Release 2.0.0 2009-06-15 ************************
- Dramatically reduced a number of threads, which PA produces (on both server and client sides).
- Slight redesign of the packet forwarder. PA now requires a factor of 3 less resources to handle each worker.
- Removed the dependency on XERCES-C library.
- The configuration file has been redesigned. Now using an INI style.
- The build system has been switched from GNU Autotools to cmake.
- Due to many bugs in FindBOOST of older versions of cmake we require cmake 2.6.4.
- Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
- New configuration parameter - client.shutdown_if_idle_for_sec. Shut down a worker if its idle time is higher than this value.
- Cosmetic changes.

********************* Release 1.0.5 2008-08-20 ************************
- Fixed typos.
- The project has been moved to Eclipse 3.4 "Ganymede".
- Fixed an improper behavior when PROOFAgent workers fail to connect to XROOTD on Grid WNs [Trac Ticket #76].

********************* Release 1.0.4 2008-06-13 ************************
- documentation has been updated.
- minor fixes.
