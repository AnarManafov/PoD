********************* Release 2.1.1 2009-10-20 ************************
- using a central user-defaults configuration ($POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg). 
- a general optimization has been done. A virt. Memory footprint is reduced by a factor of 10. A significant increase of the speed.
- added idle time-out watchers for servers and workers. Shutdown a node (a worker or a server) when idle for a defined amount of time.
- server's script has been cleaned up and now also relays on PoD's user defaults.
- jobs' wrapper script has been cleaned up.
- introduced a new algorithm for automatic port mapping.

Configuration update:
   - added <worker.set_my_rootsys>. Set to "yes" if you want to use a custom version of the ROOT on workers. PoD set ROOTSYS env.variable to a value defined by <worker.my_rootsys>.
   - added <worker.my_rootsys>. Set to a path to a custom ROOT version.

Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== pod-agent v2.1.1 (2009-10-20) with the following changes:
   - project's has been renamed to pod-agent.
   - use now PoD's user defaults ($POD_LOCATION/etc/PoD.cfg) for configuration options.
   - a new proxy machinery based on a thread-pool pattern. This gives PoD a significant speed improvements in cases when PROOF does file validation and merging and when many workers are used.
   - a number of threads in the pool and a read buffer size can be changed via PoD's user defaults configuration file. 
   - when in the worker mode, use a server_info.cfg file, where a host name and a port number of the agent server are stored.
   - added new program options: 
      - "proofport" - a PROOF (xproof) port. Used only by agents in a worker mode
      - "serverinfo" - a server info file name. Default is $POD_LOCATION/etc/server_info.cfg
   - support Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.
   - a log level is now can be defined via PoD's user defaults configuration file.
   - a log file location is now can be defined via Pod's user defaults configuration file.
=== pod-console v1.1.1 (2009-10-20) with the following changes:
   - Renamed to pod-console.
   - Don't update server or workers page if the page is hidden.
   - Optimized LSF plug-in status updated.
   - A factor of 3 optimization of the server status update.
   - minor bugs fixes.
=== pod-user-defaults v1.0.1 (2009-10-20)

********************* Release 2.0.10 2009-07-21 ************************
Using new PROOFAgent.
   - A patch release.
     The patch addresses some stability issues and most importantly fixes a hanging-on-merging issue, which was due to a loose of TCP packages.
     Workers where sending data without checking that server could be temporary unavailable due to a full buffer of the socket.

********************* Release 2.0.9 2009-07-11 ************************
- A patched version, tuned for ROOT 5.24. Released because PROOF changed the way it handles variables in xrd config. file.

********************* Release 2.0.8 2009-06-16 ************************
- Switch to $POD_LOCATION instead of $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION.
- Using PROOFAgent's new configuration file.
- A better handling of multiple PoD workers on the same worker node started in the same time.
- Many minor fixes.
Submodules:
=== GAW v3.2.0
=== PROOFAgent v2.0.0 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Dramatically reduced a number of threads, which PA produces (on both server and client sides).
   - A slight redesign of the packet forwarder. PA now requires a factor of 3 less resources to handle each worker.
   - Removed the dependency on XERCES-C library.
   - The configuration file has been redesigned. Now using an INI style.
   - The build system has been switched from GNU Autotools to cmake.
   - Due to many bugs in FindBOOST of older versions of cmake we require cmake 2.6.4.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - New configuration parameter - client.shutdown_if_idle_for_sec. Shut down a worker if its idle time is higher than this value.
   - Cosmetic changes.
=== PAConsole v1.0.7 (2009-06-15) with the following changes:
   - Source code cleaning.
   - Switched from $GLITE_PROOF_LOCATION to $POD_LOCATION.
   - Using new PROOFAgent's configuration file.
   - Fixed a case when several users run a PoD server and PAConsole couldn't recognize properly whether PoD runs or not.
   - LSF plug-in:
      * use LSF's queue information to limit the maximum number of workers in GUI.

********************* Release 2.0.7 2009-04-30 ************************
- project has been renamed to "PROOF on Demand" (PoD).
- PAConsole now supports job manager plug-ins. Currently gLite and LSF plug-ins are officially supported.
- supporting LSF plug-in an workers on LSF.
- dynamic ports configuration is now sopported on PoD workers and server. PoD chooses ports for XRD, XPROOF and PROOFAgent on the fly during the start of the server of workers.
- cosmetic changes.
- using GAW v.3.2.0, PROOFAgent 1.0.5 and PAConsole 1.0.6 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

********************* Release 2.0.6 2008-09-02 ************************

- this version is based on ROOT 5.18 (see: workers are dropped if use ROOT 5.20 or ROOT 5.21.02 - [Trac Ticket #72] )
- implemented a part of [Trac Ticket #53].
  Since r1963 there is a possibility to use xrootd pools on WNs.
  When users can't use external xrootd clusters or any other data source,
  they may want to use local WNs as pools. In this case gLitePROOF makes UI
  as a redirector and all connected workers as servers. And one can use xrdcp
  to distribute data files on the cluster. Example:
     xrdcp dstarmb0.root root://depc218.gsi.de:20094//tmp/
  Where depc218.gsi.de - is a gLitePROOF UI and 20094 is a port for xrootd (1094 - is a default one).
  In the current implementation there is only one major restriction, that a port,
  which the user has assigned for xrootd should be opened on WNs.
  In the next version of PROOFAgent there will a proxy provided,
  so that this restriction will be voided.
- documentation has been updated.
- minor bugs have been fixed.
- Added an ability to download a PROOF log files from worker nodes. [Trac Ticket #77]
- using GAW v.3.2.0.1974, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.5.1977 and PAConsole 1.0.5 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).

********************* Release 2.0.5 2008-06-13 ************************

- gLitePROOF.sh - a grid job script, its error and signal handling has been improved [Trac Ticket #52].
- added the latest PAConsole.
- documentation has been updated.
- using GAW v.3.1.0.1880, PROOFAgent v. 1.0.4.1883 and PAConsole 1.0.4 (see apps' ReleaseNotes files for more details).
